Snake Water Gun Game
Description:

Welcome to my first game project - the Snake Water Gun game! This is a simple yet fun Python-based game that I created to practice my programming skills. The game is similar to the classic Rock Paper Scissors game but with a twist.

How to Play:

The game is played between you and the computer.
You can choose between three options: Snake, Water, or Gun.
The rules are:
Snake drinks Water.
Gun shoots Snake.
Water douses Gun.
The computer will randomly select its choice, and the winner is determined based on the rules above.
Features:

Simple and intuitive text-based interface.
Randomized computer choices for unpredictable gameplay.
Clear instructions and easy-to-understand rules.
Tech Stack:

Python
I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it! Feel free to check out the code, and any feedback or suggestions are welcome.
